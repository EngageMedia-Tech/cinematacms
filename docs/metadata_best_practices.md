## ‚úÖ Best Practices

### 1. **Use Consistent Formatting**
- Remove filename extensions like .mp4, .mov, etc. 
- Capitalize titles correctly: `The Future of Forests`, not `the future of forests`
- Separate tags with commas
- Use standard country names and ISO language codes when possible

### 2. **Write for Your Audience**
- Use accessible language and avoid jargon in descriptions
- Include context (e.g., region, community, cause) for better relevance

### 3. **Be Specific**
- Avoid vague tags like "video", "documentary"
- Instead, use `environment`, `indigenous voices`, `Southeast Asia`, etc.

### 4. **Include a License**
- Creative Commons licenses (e.g., CC BY, CC BY-SA) encourage sharing
- Clearly state if the content is under a restrictive or open license

### 5. **Keep It Updated**
- Revise metadata when re-uploading or updating content
- Ensure accuracy if the content has been localized, edited, or captioned

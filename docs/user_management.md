# User Management for CinemataCMS

User management in **CinemataCMS** ensures that the right individuals have the appropriate access to the platformâ€™s features and content. This guide will walk through the process of creating, managing users, handling user roles, and managing permissions to ensure security and usability.

## Creating and Managing Users

CinemataCMS supports user creation through the **Django Admin Interface** and the **Django Shell**. You can create new users and assign roles directly via the admin panel or using Django commands.

### Managing User Roles

Roles in CinemataCMS define the level of access users have to the system. There are three primary roles:

- **Admin User**: Full administrative access to all system features and configurations.
- **Staff User**: Can access the admin panel but with limited functionality.
- **Regular User**: Typically non-administrative users who interact with the content.

#### Admin User
- **Permissions**: Full access to system features, including managing users and content.
- **Use Case**: A user with admin privileges can manage all aspects of the platform and should be trusted with system configuration.

#### Staff User
- **Permissions**: Staff users can view and manage content but cannot alter system configurations.
- **Use Case**: Staff users might manage media, moderate content, and perform general content-related tasks but cannot configure system settings.

#### Regular User
- **Permissions**: Regular users have no access to the admin panel but can interact with the front-end content.
- **Use Case**: Regular users generally view and interact with content on the site (e.g., video watching, commenting).

### Managing User Groups

Managing user groups is essential for scaling user management. Groups allow administrators to assign sets of permissions to multiple users at once.

1. **Create a New Group**:
   - In the **Django Admin Panel**, go to the **Groups** section.
   - Create groups such as **Content Editors**, **Moderators**, etc.
   
2. **Assign Permissions to Groups**:
   - Each group can have a set of permissions such as `can_edit_content`, `can_delete_content`, etc.
   - Groups can be assigned roles that will automatically grant permissions to all users within that group.

3. **Assign Users to Groups**:
   - Under the **Users** section, you can add users to groups. Users inherit the permissions of the groups they are assigned to.

## User Roles and Permissions

To manage access effectively, **CinemataCMS** offers granular control over user roles and permissions. These can be adjusted through the **Django Admin Panel** or via the shell for more advanced configurations.

1. **Assigning Permissions**:
   - Permissions like `can_upload_content`, `can_edit_content`, and `can_delete_content` can be granted to specific users or groups.
   
2. **Granular Access Control**:
   - Admin users can modify the permissions of staff or regular users through the **Django Admin Panel** to allow or restrict access to certain sections of the CMS, such as content management or user management.

## Best Practices for User Management

1. **Use Strong Passwords**:
   Ensure that all users, especially admins, use strong passwords. Enable **two-factor authentication** (2FA) where possible.

2. **Limit Superuser Access**:
   Only a few trusted individuals should have superuser access. Limit the number of superusers for enhanced security.

3. **Assign Permissions Based on Roles**:
   Avoid assigning individual permissions to users. Instead, create user groups and assign permissions to the group for easier management.

4. **Review User Access Regularly**:
   Periodically audit user roles and permissions to ensure users have the appropriate access. Revoke unnecessary permissions or roles.

5. **Backup User Data**:
   Regularly back up user data, including role assignments and content permissions, to ensure that user configurations are not lost.

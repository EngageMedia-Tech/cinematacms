# System Performance Monitoring and Optimization for CinemataCMS
Maintaining optimal performance of **CinemataCMS** requires continuous monitoring and periodic optimization of system resources, the database, and application-level components. This guide outlines essential tools, metrics, and optimization steps to ensure consistent and efficient performance of the CMS.

## Monitoring Tools

### System Resource Monitoring

Use Linux-native or third-party tools to monitor CPU, memory, disk usage, and network performance:

- `htop`, `top`: Real-time resource usage
- `iotop`: Monitor disk I/O activity
- `df -h`: Monitor disk space usage
- `netstat`, `iftop`: Monitor network connections and bandwidth
- `uptime`, `loadavg`: Monitor system load

For long-term monitoring:

- **Grafana + Prometheus**
- **Netdata**
- **Nagios**
- **Zabbix**

### Application-Level Monitoring

Django and web server performance can be monitored using:

- Django Debug Toolbar (for development)
- Sentry (for logging and performance insights)
- New Relic or Datadog (for production-level APM)
- PostgreSQL logs and query analysis tools (e.g., `pg_stat_statements`)

---

## Performance Metrics

Key metrics to monitor:

- CPU and memory usage spikes
- Disk I/O wait and latency
- HTTP request latency and throughput
- Database query execution time
- Number of slow queries
- Media processing times (uploads/transcoding)
- Web server (Nginx/Gunicorn) response times

## Optimization Procedures

### Database Optimization

- **Indexing**: Ensure frequently queried fields are properly indexed.
- **Vacuum and Analyze**: Use `VACUUM` and `ANALYZE` regularly to optimize PostgreSQL performance.
- **Connection Pooling**: Use tools like `pgbouncer` to manage database connections.
- **Slow Query Logging**: Enable PostgreSQL slow query logs and optimize inefficient queries.

### Media File Handling

- **Transcoding Queue**: Use background workers (e.g., Celery) to handle media processing.
- **Storage Optimization**: Use external storage (e.g., AWS S3) for large media files.
- **Compression**: Use video compression settings to reduce storage and bandwidth usage.

### Django and Web Server Tuning

- **Gunicorn**:
  - Adjust `--workers` and `--threads` based on server cores.
  - Use `--timeout` wisely to avoid hanging requests.
- **Nginx**:
  - Enable gzip compression.
  - Use caching headers for static files.
- **Static and Media Files**:
  - Use `collectstatic` to serve static files via Nginx or CDN.
- **Middleware and Caching**:
  - Use Djangoâ€™s caching framework (e.g., Memcached, Redis).
  - Minimize unnecessary middleware.

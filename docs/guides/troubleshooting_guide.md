## üßë‚Äçüíª 1. User Cannot Access Expected Features

### üîç Problem
- User reports missing menu items or inaccessible pages  
- "Permission Denied" or similar errors when navigating the platform

### ‚úÖ Steps to Resolve
1. **Check Assigned Roles**  
   Go to `Auth > Users` and confirm that the user has the correct role(s).

2. **Verify Role Permissions**  
   Ensure the role(s) contain relevant permissions (e.g., `read:content`, `edit:content`, etc.).

3. **Review Group Memberships**  
   Check if the user belongs to appropriate groups that inherit necessary permissions.

4. **Impersonate Temporarily**  
   Assign the same role(s) to your account and replicate the issue to test.

## üîê 2. Cannot Edit or Remove Certain Content

### üîç Problem
- Content appears in dashboards but cannot be modified or removed  
- Error indicating insufficient permissions

### ‚úÖ Steps to Resolve
1. **Validate Role Permissions**  
   Make sure the user has `edit:content`, `delete:content`, or broader access where required.

2. **Content Ownership Limitations**  
   If using `edit:own`, ensure the user attempting to edit is the original creator.

3. **Check Object-Level Constraints**  
   If object-level permissions are enabled, confirm that the user has access to specific content items.

## üéõÔ∏è 3. Role or Permission Changes Not Applying

### üîç Problem
- Updates to roles or permissions seem to have no effect  
- Users still lack access after configuration changes

### ‚úÖ Steps to Resolve
1. **Clear Cache**  
   If the platform uses caching, refresh or restart services to reflect changes.

2. **Re-authenticate the User**  
   Ask the user to log out and log in again to reload permission contexts.

3. **Check for Role Conflicts**  
   Multiple roles with overlapping or missing permissions may cause inconsistent behavior.

## üìπ 4. Video Uploads Not Appearing in Public Interface

### üîç Problem
- Videos are uploaded successfully but not publicly visible  
- Content curators do not receive notifications

### ‚úÖ Steps to Resolve
1. **Check Video Visibility Settings**  
   Ensure the video is not still marked as `private` or `unlisted`.

2. **Determine User Type**  
   - Uploads by regular users are private by default and require review.  
   - Trusted users can assign visibility immediately.

3. **Verify Notification Delivery**  
   Check if the platform is sending notification emails successfully.

4. **Review Moderation Queue**  
   Go to the content moderation dashboard and check for pending reviews.

## üë• 5. Unable to Update User Group Assignments

### üîç Problem
- Attempts to add/remove users from groups fail  
- Changes to group settings are not saved

### ‚úÖ Steps to Resolve
1. **Ensure Permission to Manage Users**  
   Confirm the user managing roles has `manage:users` permission.

2. **Use Correct Workflow**  
   Navigate to each user's profile via `Auth > Users > [Username]` and edit their group memberships.

3. **Inspect Group Configuration**  
   Make sure the group exists and includes the intended permissions.

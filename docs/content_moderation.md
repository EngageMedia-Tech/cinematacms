## üîê 2. Access Level Assignment

| User Type       | Upload Visibility       | Notes                                                                 |
|------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Trusted User** | Can choose visibility (`public`, `unlisted`, `private`, `password-protected`) | Bypasses preliminary moderation but still subject to review post-publish. |

## üì£ 3. Notification System

Upon upload:

- An **automated email notification** is sent to the Cinemata **Curatorial Team**.
- Notifications include: uploader identity, title, visibility, and a link to the review queue.

Optional integrations (e.g., Slack, Mattermost) can supplement this via webhook alerts.

## üßê 4. Content Review Process

### Step-by-step:

1. **Access the Moderation Queue**
   - Located in the Admin UI under `Content > Pending Review`
   - Or via direct moderation dashboard for curators.

2. **Evaluate Content Based on**:
   - Cinemata‚Äôs [Editorial Policy](#)
   - Relevance to regional and thematic focus
   - Copyright compliance
   - Production quality (basic minimum)

3. **Flag or Delete** if:
   - Content is irrelevant (e.g., generic vlog, commercial ad)
   - Obvious copyright violation
   - Spam, offensive, or AI-generated junk

4. **Escalate** complex cases to:
   - **Content Lead** for editorial disputes
   - **Technical Maintainers** if related to abusive automation

5. **Optional Notes**:
   - Curators can leave moderation comments stored as metadata for internal review history.

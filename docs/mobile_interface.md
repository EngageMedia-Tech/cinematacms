## Mobile Interface Features

- **Responsive Layout**  
  The layout adjusts fluidly to smaller screen widths, reorganizing content blocks to maintain clarity and usability. Key elements such as navigation menus, video thumbnails, and playback controls resize and reposition for mobile screens.

- **Navigation**  
  - A collapsible hamburger menu provides access to site sections (Home, Upload, Categories, Account) without cluttering the limited screen space.  
  - Sticky bottom navigation may be implemented for quick access to primary actions such as Home, Search, Upload, and Profile.

- **Video Playback**  
  - Videos scale responsively to fit the screen width while maintaining aspect ratio.  
  - Controls (play/pause, volume, full screen) remain easily tappable and accessible.  
  - Support for portrait and landscape orientations with smooth transitions.

- **Search bar**  
  Search bars or slide in/out to optimize space usage on mobile devices.

- **Comments and Social Features**  
  Comment threads and social sharing buttons are stacked vertically and use touch-friendly elements for interaction.

## Responsive Design Considerations

- **Fluid Grids and Flexible Images**  
  The site uses CSS grid and flexbox layouts with relative units (%, rem, vh, vw) instead of fixed pixels to allow elements to shrink or expand based on screen size. Images and videos use `max-width: 100%` to prevent overflow.

- **Media Queries**  
  Multiple CSS media queries target common mobile viewport widths (e.g., max-width: 480px, 768px) to apply specific styles such as:  
  - Adjusting font sizes for readability on small screens.  
  - Hiding or collapsing non-essential elements to reduce clutter.  
  - Modifying padding/margins for better tap targets.

- **Touch Targets and Accessibility**  
  Interactive elements maintain minimum touch target sizes (at least 44x44 pixels) to ensure ease of use on touchscreen devices. Color contrast and font legibility are tested for mobile viewing conditions.

- **Performance Optimization**  
  Images and video thumbnails are served in optimized resolutions suitable for mobile bandwidth constraints. Lazy loading techniques are employed to speed up initial page load.

- **Orientation Handling**  
  The interface detects orientation changes and adjusts layout accordingly, ensuring video playback and navigation remain consistent whether the device is held portrait or landscape.

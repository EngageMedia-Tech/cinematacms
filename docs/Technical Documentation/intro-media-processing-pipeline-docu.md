# Media Processing Pipeline

CinemataCMS's sophisticated media processing pipeline is a core component that transforms raw uploaded files into optimized, streamable content with transcriptions. This documentation is critical because it exposes the "black box" of media handling, helping developers understand how encoding profiles are applied, how large files are chunked for parallel processing, and how transcriptions are generated. Without this documentation, troubleshooting encoding failures or extending the pipeline becomes significantly more difficult, potentially leading to performance issues or broken functionality.

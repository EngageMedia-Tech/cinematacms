# 📈 CinemataCMS System Performance Monitoring & Optimization Guide

This document outlines the standard procedures, tools, and practices used to monitor and optimize system performance in CinemataCMS. The goal is to ensure smooth content delivery, stable backend operations, and quick response times for all users and administrators.

## 🧠 Key Monitoring Objectives

- **Server Health**: CPU, memory, disk usage, and uptime.
- **Application Performance**: Request latency, database response times, media load speed.
- **Video Delivery**: Transcoding success, CDN cache hits, stream buffering issues.
- **Task Queues**: Background job latency (e.g., speech-to-text, transcoding).
- **Database Efficiency**: Query times, index usage, lock contention.
- **Error Tracking**: Real-time visibility into exceptions and failed processes.
- **Traffic Patterns**: Request volumes, peak load handling, rate limiting triggers.

## 🚦 Monitoring Dashboard Overview

Dashboards are typically organized into:

### 1. **System Health Dashboard**
- CPU load average
- Memory usage
- Disk I/O
- Network throughput

### 2. **Application Performance**
- API response time (P50, P90, P99)
- Request count per endpoint
- HTTP error rates (4xx/5xx)
- Slow view detections

### 3. **Media Pipeline**
- Transcode duration per video
- Whisper transcription job queue time
- CDN cache miss rate
- File upload failure rates

### 4. **Database Health**
- Top slow queries
- Table scan vs index usage
- Active connections
- Lock wait times

## 🔁 Optimization Procedures

### 🧩 General Backend

- **Use Django QuerySet `.select_related()` and `.prefetch_related()`** to avoid N+1 problems.
- Enable **caching** with Redis or Memcached for expensive queries or anonymous views.
- Periodically audit `DEBUG` settings and ensure they are disabled in production.
- Use **Gunicorn workers** tuned to match CPU cores and I/O needs.

### 🗃️ Database Optimization

- Regularly run `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` on slow queries.
- Add missing **indexes** on frequently filtered fields (e.g., `user_id`, `created_at`).
- Avoid unbounded pagination; implement keyset or offset limits.
- Archive old logs/media records to reduce table size.

### 🌐 Frontend & Delivery

- Use **lazy loading** for thumbnails and components.
- Minify and compress assets via Webpack / Django Compressor.
- Optimize thumbnails and video preview images (WebP preferred).
- Serve static/media content via a **CDN**.

### 📹 Video & Media

- Transcode videos into standardized resolutions (e.g., 720p, 1080p).
- Store transcoded versions on a cloud bucket (e.g., S3, GCS).
- Use signed URLs or streaming tokens to protect direct media access.
- Monitor **upload throughput** and user drop rates for upload failures.

## ⚙️ Routine Maintenance Schedule

| Task                              | Frequency         |
|-----------------------------------|-------------------|
| Check system dashboards           | Daily             |
| Review Sentry alerts              | Daily             |
| Restart Celery workers            | Weekly (or on demand) |
| Vacuum & analyze PostgreSQL       | Weekly            |
| Rebuild search indexes (if used)  | Weekly            |
| Test backup restores              | Monthly           |
| Audit query performance           | Monthly           |
| Load test high traffic endpoints  | Quarterly         |

## 🔐 Alerting & Incident Response

- Use **Prometheus Alertmanager** or cloud provider alerts for thresholds (CPU > 80%, DB latency > 500ms).
- Integrate alerts with Slack/Email/Discord for real-time notifications.
- Define **incident severity levels** and escalation contacts.
- Maintain an internal **runbook** for known issues and
